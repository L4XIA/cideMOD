Dimensional model
==================

The well-known P2D model described by :cite:t:`Doyle1993` is considered
herein as a baseline. As each domain is normalized with its thickness,
the gradients used are:

.. math::

    \begin{gathered}
        \nabla = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{L_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{x}} \\ \frac{1}{H_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{y}} \\ \frac{1}{W_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{z}} \end{pmatrix}
    \end{gathered}

Where :math:`L_i`, :math:`H_i` and :math:`W_i` are the domain thickness,
height and width. However, in the case of the P2D model, only the first
row of the vector is used.

* Mass transport in the electrolyte
    The mass transport in the electrolyte is calculated in
    :func:`c_e_equation <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.c_e_equation>`
    function.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \epsilon \frac{\partial c_e}{\partial t} =
            \nabla \left( D_{eff} \nabla c_e \right) + \frac{1}{F}\sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i}
        \end{gathered}

* Charge transport in the electrolyte
    The charge transport in the electrolyte is calculated in
    :func:`phi_e_equation <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.phi_e_equation>`
    function.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            - \nabla \left( \kappa_{eff} \nabla \varphi_e  - 2 \kappa_{eff} \frac{RT}{F} (1-t_0) \left(1+\frac{\partial \ln{f_{\pm}}}{\partial \ln{c_e}}\right) \nabla \ln{c_e}  \right) = \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i}
        \end{gathered}

* Charge transport in the electrode
    The charge transport in the solid electron conductor materials is calculated in
    :func:`phi_s_equation <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.phi_s_equation>`
    function.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            - \nabla \left( \sigma_{eff} \nabla \varphi_s \right) = - \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i}

            \sigma_{eff} \nabla \varphi_s \Big|_{tab} = I_{app}
        \end{gathered}

    In the current colectors, a similar equation is used, but in this
    case, there is no exchage with the electrolyte, therefore the right
    hand side term equals zero.

* Mass transport in the active material (pseudodimension)
    The mass transport in the active material is calculated in the
    :class:`SpectralLegendreModel <cideMOD.models.particle_models.implicit_coupling.SpectralLegendreModel>`
    class using Legendre polynomials.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \frac{\partial c_s}{\partial t} =
            \nabla \left( D_s^{eff} \nabla c_s \right)
            \quad ; \quad
            - D_s^{eff} \nabla c_s \Bigg|_{r=R_p} = \frac{j_{i}}{F}
        \end{gathered}

* Exchange between the electrolyte and the electrode by lithium
  intercalation. The intercalation exchange current between the
  electrolyte and the active materials is calculated in
  :func:`j_int <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.j_Li_equation>`

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            j_i = F k_0 c_e^\alpha c_s^{1-\alpha} (1-c_s)^\alpha \left(e^{\frac{-\alpha F}{RT} \eta }-e^{\frac{(1-\alpha) F}{RT} \eta} \right)
        \end{gathered}

    The overpotential at each part of the electrode is calculated in the
    :func:`overpotential <cideMOD.models.electrochemical.equations.overpotential>`
    function.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \eta = \varphi_s - \varphi_e - U_{eq}(c_s^{surf})
        \end{gathered}

.. rubric:: Thermal Model

    The heat transfer across the cell is computed in the
    :func:`T_equation <cideMOD.models.thermal.equations.T_equation>`
    function.

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =
            \nabla \left( \lambda_{eff} \nabla T \right) + q
            \quad ; \quad
            - \lambda_{eff} \nabla T \Bigg|_{\Gamma}= h (T-T_{ext})
        \end{gathered}

* Heat generation:
    Several heat sources have been considered. The formulation of this
    heat sources is based on :cite:t:`Chiew2019`
    
    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            q = q_{ohm}+q_{rev}+q_{irr}
        \end{gathered}
    
    * Ohmic heat source
        This corresponds to the heat generated by the transport of
        charge within the cell. It is calculated in the
        :func:`solid_ohmic_heat_equation <cideMOD.models.thermal.equations.solid_ohmic_heat_equation>`
        function:

        .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                q_{ohm} =  (1-\varepsilon) q_{solid} + \varepsilon q_{liquid} \\
                q_{solid} =  \sigma_{eff} \nabla \varphi_s \nabla \varphi_e \\
                q_{liquid} = \kappa_{eff} \nabla \varphi_e \nabla \varphi_e - 2 \kappa_{eff} \frac{RT}{F} (1-t_0^+) \left(1+\frac{\partial \ln{f_{\pm}}}{\partial \ln{c_e}}\right) \frac{\nabla c_e}{c_e} \nabla \varphi_e
            \end{gathered}

    * Reversible reaction heat source
        The reversible heat caused by the reaction is proportional to
        the entropy change, that is approximated with the variation of
        Open Circuit potential. It is calculated in the
        :func:`reaction_reversible_heat <cideMOD.models.thermal.equations.reaction_reversible_heat>`
        function.

        .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                q_{rev} =  \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i} T \frac{\partial U_i(c_s)}{\partial T}
            \end{gathered}

    * Irreversible polarization heat source
        This represents the irreversible heating due to the
        polarization heat generated by the exchange current at the
        electrolyte-electrode interface. It is calculated in the
        :func:`reaction_irreversible_heat <cideMOD.models.thermal.equations.reaction_irreversible_heat>`

        .. math::

                q_{rev} =  \sum_{i=0}^{n_{mat}} a_i j_{i} \eta
            \end{gathered}

.. rubric:: Degradation Models

* SEI formation side reaction
    This model is implemented inside the
    :class:`SEI <cideMOD.models.degradation.equations.SEI>` class.
    The model considers that the SEI is originated by the
    electrochemical reaction between EC solvent molecule, 2 lithium
    ions and 2 electrons at the electrode surface:

    .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                EC + 2 Li^+ + 2 e^- \rightarrow V_{SEI}
            \end{gathered}
    
    Therefore the rection equation reads:

    .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                j_{SEI} = F k_{SEI} c_{EC} c_s e^{\frac{-\beta F}{RT}(\eta - (U_{SEI} - U_{eq}))}
            \end{gathered}

    where the concentration of EC solvent at the SEI must be modelled
    according to the transport equation:

    .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                \frac{\partial c_{EC}}{\partial t} = \nabla \left( D_{EC} \nabla c_{EC} - \frac{ \partial \delta_{SEI}}{\partial t} c_{EC} \right)
            \end{gathered}

    with the following boundary conditions:

    .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                \left( D_{EC} \nabla c_{EC} - \frac{ \partial \delta_{SEI}}{\partial t} c_{EC} \right) \Bigg|_{r_{SEI}=R_s} = \frac{j_{SEI}}{F}
                \quad ; \quad
                c_{EC} \big|_{r_{SEI}=R_s+\delta_{SEI}} = c_{EC}^0
            \end{gathered}

    The SEI growth can be calculated from the reaction rate and SEI
    components properties:

    .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                \frac{\partial \delta_{SEI}}{\partial t} = - \frac{M_{SEI}}{2 F \rho_{SEI}} j_{SEI}
            \end{gathered}

    The total exchange current therefore has two components:

    .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                j_{tot} = j_{int} + j_{SEI}
            \end{gathered}

    And the overpotential has now an additional component corresponding
    to the voltage drop caused by SEI resistance:

    .. math::

            \begin{gathered}
                \eta = \varphi_s - \varphi_e - U_{eq}(c_s) - \frac{\delta_{SEI}}{\kappa_{SEI}} j_{tot} 
            \end{gathered}

* LAM model
    This model is implemented inside the
    :class:`SEI <cideMOD.models.degradation.equations.SEI>` class.
    The model computes the lost of active material due to particle
    cracking driven by stresses. Therefore, the decrease of the volume
    fraction of active material is computed as

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \sigma_\mathrm{h}=\frac{\sigma_\mathrm{r}+2\sigma_\mathrm{t}
            }{3}=\frac{2\Omega E}{9\left ( 1-\nu \right )}\left ( 
            3\int_{0}^{R}\tilde{c}r^2dr-\tilde{c} \right )
        \end{gathered}

    And the hydrostatic stress is computed from the equilibrium of
    stresses of a spherical electrode particle

    .. math::

        \begin{gathered}
            \frac{\partial \varepsilon_\mathrm{s}}{\partial t}=-\beta
            \left ( \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{h}}{\sigma_\mathrm{cr}} 
            \right )^m \qquad \sigma_\mathrm{h}>0
        \end{gathered}
