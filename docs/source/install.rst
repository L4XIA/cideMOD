Installation
=============

The preferred way to install and use cideMOD is using the Docker image
of cideMOD at `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/cidetec/cidemod>`_. Optionally, one can install cideMOD in a FEniCS working
environment (with multiphenics) by downloading everything from source, also multiphenics is
available via Docker image, and installing it with the Python package manager.
